            Kumbakonam is an idyllic town skirted by Cauvery and Arasalar rivers. Popular as a temple town, Kumbakonam is home to around 188 temples, the most prominent of which is the Kumbeswarar Temple. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, it is the oldest shrine in the area, built in the 7th century. The best time to visit is during the celebrations of the Mahamaham Festival. Another attraction is the 12-storey-high Sarangapani Temple built by the Nayak kings. Raghunatha Nayak, who ruled the town in the 16th century, got scenes from Ramayana painted on the walls of the Ramaswamy Temple. Kumbakonam is also known to have a temple dedicated to Lord Brahma, the Hindu god who is responsible for the creation of the universe and of life on earth. There are very few temples of Lord Brahma in the world and Kumbakonam has one of them.
